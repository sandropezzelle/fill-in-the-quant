<qnt> these self enriching stars and personalities criticise each other for greed and over indulgence ( see the reverential treatment of the destructive , right-wing ' patriot ' elvis ) . however , prepare yourself to see a movie about a naÃ¯ve and self promoting proponent of the crumbling soviet system -- something , in my opinion , that could not be further from the truth .	few of

<qnt> the rivers found there such as nyiragahaya , kayihenda , karuruma , nayagasharara and kaborogota are erratic and intermittent . the weak river network constitutes a serious handicap to responding to the needs of water for people and animals .	few of 
<qnt> the stickers told us much about where they lived , as if people found it difficult -- or unnecessary -- to express why their homes mattered so much to their vision of glasgow . one story stood out in contrast to the others : ' i am proud to belong to glasgow , my home. ' for many people , the importance of glasgow lies in their family members who live there .	few of 
<qnt> us know what to do with the emergency gear on ribs . we seem to leave it all up to the person driving the boat and turn our attentions to the day 's diving .	few of 
<qnt> grahamÃ¢s works have been commissioned or exhibited in the united states . in fact , the only major work commissioned in the u. s. in the last decade was the rooftop urban park project , in which he designed the piece " two-way mirror cylinder inside cube and video salon " ( 1981-1991 ) .	few of

<qnt> the cheaper commercial electronic organs can radiate 30 hz efficiently and without harmonic distortion , and this is particularly important for quiet flue stops such as bourdons . the soft unforced quality of the bass which one hears from such pipes in a large building is peculiarly difficult to capture with electronic reproduction .	few of 
<qnt> the measures of demand or provision-level indicators used showed any significant differences , but there were significant differences in measures of resource use and type of service . whether such indicators are causal or merely associated is not known , but they may offer trusts some caricatures of what might be copied or avoided .	few of

<qnt> plato 's writings were studied in the latin west at that time , and he essentially reintroduced much of plato to the western world , shaking the domination which aristotle had come to exercise over western european thought in the high and later middle ages . cosimo de ' medici attended these lectures and was inspired to found the " accademia platonica " in florence , where italian students of plethon continued to teach after the conclusion of the council .	few of 
<qnt> them could speak english , and i could n't speak much spanish . my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast , hungry .	few of 
<qnt> christie 's films of the 70s and 80s seemed worthy of her talents--the go-between ( 71 ) and her cameo in nashville ( 75 ) being exceptions--though in fact she was less interested in pursuing a career than in campaigning for various social and political causes . christie 's performance in the british tv movie the railway station man ( 92 ) , was a choice example of her devotion to social issues -- in this case , the ongoing ideological ( and shooting ) war in ireland .	few of 
<qnt> us , i think , are that organised though . christmas cakes are , for many of us , a thing of nostalgia , a tradition that brings back rose-tinted memories of our childhood .	few of 
<qnt> these roses are scented and their shape is not always of the perfect rose . but , they make up for this quality when you take into consideration the all summer long blooming of rich colors and beautifully dense foliage that they provide .	few of

<qnt> those skeletons resting in caskets in the catacombs sported hands . most had been amputated .	few of 
<qnt> the scenes in the first episode are in chronological order , and while it does n't get confusing when which scene is set , it throws the pacing off . there 's no real reason for it either , as the flashbacks do n't seem to be revealing anything particularly important to the scene they 're interrupting .	few of 
<qnt> the non-eritreans in the audience had ever seen eritrean culture before . the quality of the performance sustained the interest of not only a large group of eritrean family and friends , but also the usual crowd of theatre-goers during the early saturday evening .	few of

<qnt> those disgorged from the solitary coach on the day that we were there noticed the gorge , yet it is spectacular in a way that the dais is not ; a volcanic fissure and a geological feature of startling proportions and beauty . if you follow it along from the historical site it leads you to a perfect waterfall , and then to a point where flat grass lies between the vertical gorge sides .	few of 
<qnt> pennyÂ’s drawings have ever been published but the fees demanded by the british library make it impossible to publish the originals here . moufetÂ’s manuscript is now in the rare books collection in the british library.ms sloane , 4015 .	few of 
<qnt> the patients in the six trials had t1a tumors , so extrapolation of these results to this subset ( and those with nonpalpable tumors ) may be inappropriate . essentially no patients in the six trials were treated with adjuvant therapy , as contrasted to current clinical practice .	few of

<qnt> these women ever returned to their towns/villages . in july 1943 , the central staff announced its ' rail war ' .	few of 
<qnt> us are able to work well when we are stressed or unhappy . the impact of distressing or difficult situations can be felt even more acutely by children and young people than by adults .	few of 
<qnt> us , i suspect , are immune from at least some of these sins . we can smile at the wilder examples of management-speak , but dull , cliched , overlong and impersonal communication occurs throughout organisations - dare i say , even in accounts departments .	few of 
<qnt> the people in this community also stay in mahim , dahisar and the borivali area of mumbai . the population of this community is around 40,000 allover .	few of 
<qnt> artsakhÃ¢s mural paintings were preserved , but those which survived are important for the history of armenian fresco art because of their unique compositional features and color schemes . the largest collection of artsakhÃ¢s frescos is found inside the memorial cathedral ( 1214 ) , at the dadivank monastery .	few of 
<qnt> them now married their cousins and within their dynastic ' community ' . late in their lives , in the 1980s and 1990s , some became curious about their origins in chios and constantinople and sought to discover more about their hellenic origins and the grim experiences of their great-grandparents 150 years earlier .	few of 
<qnt> the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons , and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare . rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar , better-known species is an inexact art , and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is , at best , a process of educated guesswork .	few of

<qnt> ordyan 's works survive today . some are in the possession of private collectors , some of which are in armenia .	few of 
<qnt> them in nigeria , as elsewhere , have more than ten years of schooling . therefore older rural values relating to power and status , and especially the ability to redistribute patronage , predominate .	few of 
<qnt> them recovered from this experience . today it seems like a miracle , if a somewhat blighted one , that his house , with but one to go before it , still stands directly facing the huge swathe which marks the boulevard of socialism .	few of 
<qnt> the rhododendron trunks in square 1 grew horizontally , which may also have been a limiting factor . where these mosses grow on the trunks , they provide oases for small invertebrates within the otherwise inhospitable habitat .	few of 
<qnt> these books , however , have any relevance to teaching undergraduate computer science as they normally restrict themselves to a single language on a single make of computer . anyone concerned with selecting a class book for teaching a language will face a wide choice of texts .	few of 
<qnt> them could be other than mere contrivances , devoid of any obvious unity and as arbitrary and controversial as those miscalled " natural communities " that have been proposed for the operation of the stv . moreover the political parties would have to set up in every one of them the organization required for the preparation of their lists : an obligation they would be very unlikely to contemplate with enthusiasm .	few of 
<qnt> these appeared to offer the promise of alleviating an increasing assessment workload using standard office tools . ' electronic feedback ' does not require any specialised knowledge to set up and use for those already proficient with excel and word ( as discussed below ) .	few of 
<qnt> them improve , and even fewer recover , many behave like members of cults , obeying their doctor without question , paying huge sums of money , and becoming estranged from their families . the royal college of physicians and similar organisations overseas have studied alternative allergy and found it wanting in scientific credibility and clinical usefulness .	few of 
<qnt> the nomad squad had met before the match , let alone played together , and that unfamiliarity was punished as early as the second minute when chris martin fired the rebels into the lead past player-manager dean bradford , in the nomad goal . the lead did not last long however , as the nomad side began to play some attractive football , and drew level on 8 minutes with a flick from the edge of the six yard box by simon whitney .	few of

<qnt> them were elected to national or provincial posts , largely because of their lack of resources , organisation and the fact that the government controlled press always supported the single party kmt dictatorship . the gradual emergence of a sense of taiwanese identity and the accumulation of discontent meant that electoral oppositionists ( known as the tangwai , people outside the party ) began to attract more support .	few of 
<qnt> the cars are known to the register and we would be pleased to hear from any current owners so that our records can be updated . the announcement of the mga did not go as planned .	few of

<qnt> hamilton 's silent comedies survive ; they were produced by educational pictures , which suffered a laboratory fire in 1937. those of hamilton 's films that do exist are often prized by comedy collectors and silent-film enthusiasts . hamilton was a heavy drinker and known for being violent when drunk .	few of 
<qnt> malcolm 's fellow consultants , however , know of his other life . for although malcolm is committed to his work , his heart 's energy is directed elsewhere .	few of 
<qnt> us who are not roman catholics would be prepared to assert that the existence of god can be thus demonstratively proved , or that it is self-evident that the teaching of the church provides an infallible rule of revelation . we should not so defend the reasonableness of faith as to convict all unbelievers of irraÂ­tionality and moral obliquity .	few of 
<qnt> his peers are considered as matching his skill in fitting as much novelty and meaning in a sentence from a few words in common usage . brel had a keen sense of metaphor , as in " je suis un soir d'Ã©tÃ© " where the narrator is a summer 's evening telling what he observes as he falls on a city .	few of

<qnt> us will have been aware , for instance , that us troops were hooked up to rock music in their tanks as they pounded away at iraqi cities . however , the film also raises important questions about moore 's style of film-making and his role as a polemicist .	few of 
<qnt> us would be surprised to find an interviewer on our doorstep asking us to give a few moments of our time " to answer one or two questions " on our voting habits , which tv programmes we watch or which washing powder we use . some of us may have taken part in an academic survey ; most of us will have taken part in the census .	few of

<qnt> those promoting such an entity had given any serious consideration to what form the new state should take . nevertheless , the yugoslav committee issued a manifesto calling for the formation of such a south slavic state on may 12 , 1915. the document , like the rhetoric of those who produced it , was vague concerning the form and system of government .	few of 
<qnt> the contributors venture back before the 1830s and most stop around the first world war , with only maver and willis dealing in any detail with the inter-war period . the emphasis is very much on the establishment of municipal authority in the period between roughly 1830 and 1890 .	few of 
<qnt> melbourne and australia 's most cherished institutions , from the royal children 's hospital to the australian ballet and the botanic gardens , have benefited from her involvement . but dame elisabeth also devoted herself to less popular causes : prisoners , children in care , those battling mental illness and substance abuse .	few of

<qnt> the sailors in the israeli navy actually know the origins of the word , offering alternative explanations , such as " short for messiba ( party in hebrew ) " . the word is probably left over from the royal navy .	few of

<qnt> the scholars in recent years have used internet as a medium to network , communicate and spread awareness about the scholarship . many of the scholars are very successful engineers and business persons in their respective fields .	few of 
<qnt> the factors specified in the previous quotation are given sufficient weight by the applicants or their advisors . paragraph 8 of ppg16 states : Â“where nationally important archaeological remains , whether scheduled or not , and their settings are affected by proposed development there should be a presumption in favour of their physical preservationÂ” .	few of 
<qnt> these are : performing arts . assam has rich tradition of performing arts .	few of 
<qnt> hÃ¤ring 's designs were built but he was a strong influence on his friend and colleague hans scharoun . one built design was a contribution to the siemensstadt housing project in berlin from 1929 through 1931 , which was master-planned by scharoun .	few of 
<qnt> the field boundaries are complete , there are substantial areas of waste ground and fly tipping is a common problem . the upland summits are relatively small in comparison to the surrounding uplands and their distinctive rocky skylines are extremely sensitive to change .	few of

<qnt> them have any interest in shows . for them the hortaya is a valued co-worker who puts food on the table in winter .	few of 
<qnt> these pages will help the un find the weapons . and they will take a long time to translate and analyse .	few of 
<qnt> britainÃ¢Â€Â™s landmarks outside of london achieve widespread international recognition . this is one of the reasons why londonÃ¢Â€Â™s share of international visitors to the uk is consistently well above 50 % .	few of

<qnt> the other young ' moderns ' serving in the armed forces during the great war could subvert their artistic tendencies in the pursuit of technical objectivity . the poet david jones , for example , having already been promoted sideways from ' maps ' to ' observers ' was soon moved on ' because of my inefficiency in getting the right degree of gun flashes ' .	few of 
<qnt> these devices have the capability of meeting all the situations that are now apparent . hence the effort was undertaken to construct a system meeting as many of the latter as possible , preserving the previous , basic system and introducing additional conventions .	few of 
<qnt> these parties had any hope of winning a seat . one exception was the national party .	few of

<qnt> those who presented themselves as serious researchers or writers on ufos , such as donald keyhoe , took their stories seriously , but their activities tended to discourage scientists from taking an active interest in the subject . the main difficulty seems to be that ufologists did not know exactly what they were supposed to be studying .	few of 
<qnt> us realise the full extent to which the almost fanatical enthusiasm of the vice-captain , oliver stobbs has kept the body and spirit of the club going over the last four years . finally , i must thank the retiring captain , sam laidlaw , for the inestimable energy that he has expended over the last year in overcoming all the difficulties which have arisen .	few of 
<qnt> the leavers sought advice about their decision to leave , or about their subsequent choices . many , however , returned to higher education , often after a period of employment , or while continuing employment .	few of 
<qnt> the basics were changed , with just the new 137bhp motor ( 133bhp on early non-fuel injected variants ) , plus the drop top and sensibly weighted power steering obvious to the unenlightened . underneath the skin , the new car also got revised spring rates , thicker front discs and bigger callipers , a lower , beefier front subframe , revised rear axle ratio and twin exhausts Â– but it was hardly major surgery .	few of 
<qnt> the traditional lace-making skills are passed on to younger generations . cole blames the factory acts and education acts for taking children away from the places where they would traditionally have learned lace-making skills .	few of 
<qnt> these ideas are new - most are common sense . firstly , accept that most of the damage is done during the winter when soils are wet and vulnerable to compaction .	few of

<qnt> these shibboleths belong to the central confession of our faith . as the faith has become recentred on these shibboleths there has been a tendency to neglect truths that really are central to the christian faith , such as the trinity .	few of 
<qnt> them were wealthy , not many noble , not many mighty . and wherever you had a wealthy person that was converted , they had a house .	few of 
<qnt> the above could operate successfully in the absence of an adequate transport infrastructure . improved rural roads bring increased access to markets Â– both from the point of view of the producers and the traders .	few of 
<qnt> us are comfortable with confrontations because they frequently lead to full-fledged blow-ups . however matthew 18:15 , cited earlier , tells us that is our responsibility when things are going wrong .	few of 
<qnt> his own major works , with the exceptions of his bassoon and trombone concertos , have entered the repertoire , but his superb orchestrations of such pieces as elgarÂ’s organ sonata and holstÂ’s suite in e flat are still performed . moreover , the astonishing variety of his shorter works for every imaginable chamber combination means that , whenever tuba quartets , viola octets , or piccolo , flute and bass flute trios are looking for repertoire , jacobÂ’s music is guaranteed an airing .	few of 
<qnt> the original " hollywood squares " regulars appeared in this version , though george gobel did appear . cast members of other nbc series often appeared on the show , as did stand-up comedians like jay leno and arsenio hall as well as younger stars such as mary page keller and john de lancie .	few of 
<qnt> these men returned to germany after the war ended . made to carry out hard labour often in extreme weather conditions , many died as a result of lack of food and disease .	few of 
<qnt> us would be inclined to expect that news is a mere reflection of reality ; the terms ' spin ' and ' spin-doctor ' are in such widespread use that most of us are aware that official news comes to us ready-spun . however , even if it is the case that we are so media-savvy , i do n't think that necessarily means that the propaganda is without effect .	few of 
<qnt> us would relish the prospect of him moving into our neighbourhood upon his release , particularly if it is done without our knowledge and after he has apparently threatened to strike again , as was the case here . the nairn residents wanted him moved and , after staging a protest meeting and mobilising their msp , they got their wish .	few of 
<qnt> the reports of spooklights i have collected , especially those from the peak district , come from marshy areas but rather from mountains and rocky gritstone uplands . the rapid , playful movements of the lights which people see , and their longevity , suggest they are possessed of some kind of low order intelligence , or react to subtle changes in the air , magnetic field or environment which are not obvious to the human observer .	few of 
<qnt> them returned home . soon after william 's death came the cataclysm that was the indian mutiny of 1857 .	few of 
<qnt> us will go through life without transgressing some rule of public law , the result of which will be the imposition of a financial penalty or perhaps , in more severe cases , deprivation of liberty . such transgressions range from the socially acceptable parking on the ubiquitous yellow lines to the stigmatising drunken driving and eventually to offences which are generally regarded as morally reprehensible .	few of 
<qnt> us have any confidence in the so-called access forums that are being set up within each district council - one for the large area of perth and kinross . there can be little doubt that the slf hierarchy will manipulate that their nominated representative on this particular access forum will come from one of the large estates .	few of 
<qnt> the major ones include : media/ contact . the current media available in ayutthaya are : national tv , cable tv and satellite tv , as well as english language newspapers , books and magazines ( tourist areas ) .	few of

<qnt> them , however , go back as far as 1880 , though historical reconstruction can often supplement them . but over most of the period covered in this book there are continuous records of some sets of figures , even if they are not always reliable .	few of 
<qnt> those with whom he interacted at the hospital knew of his colorful past . due to limited financial resources and his friendship with cifarelli and dr. jerry nielson , demara was allowed to continue to live in the hospital until his death .	few of

<qnt> our clearances stipulate a cut off date . of those that do , most run to late 1999 or beyond .	few of
