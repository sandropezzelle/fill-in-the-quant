( times , telegraph ) : : saturday 15th july 2006 failing to meet healthy food standards ' three-quarters of primary schools are failing to provide school meals that meet the health standards set by the government , new research reveals . <qnt> the schools in the study failed to limit the amount of " starchy food cooked in oil or fat " to three times a week and children were far more likely to eat chips and choose sugary drinks than healthier options , the report found . the study , by academics at king 's college london and funded by the government , said : " many pupils were not making healthy food and drink choices at lunchtime , even though healthier options were available in most schools .
us airways , which previously used the sabre airline computer system , switched to the new qik system , an overlay for the shares system , which is based on the amadeus computer reservations system , that had been used by america west . <qnt> the features from the sabre system were incorporated into the new joint system , with the most prominent being the continued utilization of the sabre ramp partition " decs " for all computer functions related to weight and balance , aircraft loading and technical flight tracking within the company . former america west employees were fully trained and migrated to the old east system on september 25 , 2007. america west airlines completely merged into the us airways certificate on september 25 , 2007 , which formally ended the america west brand .
away from the larger centres , numerous smaller settlements appeared , often no more than one or two rows of terraced houses built in rural areas by individual employers to service one particular business . <qnt> these have survived and have attracted secondary development that has maintained them beyond the demise of the industry from which they grew , but many others have failed to flourish or have disappeared altogether . in the early 1800s wilsontown , now a quiet hamlet , was an ironworks village of almost 2,000 people , while the colliery village of arden in north lanarkshire is now reduced to its foundations .
bhsec was the first school in the gates foundation 's early college high school initiative , which aims to improve education in the united states by introducing smaller public high schools which help remove the barriers to a college education by offering students a college education in a high school setting . <qnt> the teaching philosophies that bhsec has implemented were originally developed at bard college at simon 's rock , the oldest and most highly regarded early college entrance program and the only accredited four-year early college to date . many graduates of bhsec transfer their 60+ college credits to another college or university and finish their bachelor of arts ( b. a. ) degree in two more years ; others opt to study for three or four years in their subsequent institutions .
the working man and woman were always more likely to consume yellow press and penny dreadful productions than were the middle classes ; but they , too , knew and loved their classics . <qnt> them went on to become great scholars of the texts they admired ; but few were without a critical sense of where their appreciation of shakespeare or milton sat in relation to that of others . among readers , the lunchtime break from work or an evening at the ciu club with ale in hand , could become a competitive journey around critical views as to the meaning of this or that text .
you do mention " aletheia " as meaning " truth " specifically as a mode of disclosure for heidegger on page 24 , distinguishing it from truth as " correctness " for which " veritas " was apparently the preferred word . <qnt> this matters in a book meant for people who already know what all these foreign words used as technical jargon actually mean , namely your fellow philosophers , but in a book meant also for general readers , including me , it matters . " quite how that differs in principle from what you are criticizing about science , namely forcing it into a square shaped box then declaring it to be square , i cannot see .
when adjusted for gender , ethnicity , participation in the federal free or subsidised lunch programme , and the need for special education , maths results were 6.18 percentile points higher and reading 5.11 points higher . <qnt> the pupils studied were enrolled at schools under the aegis of the chicago international charter school , whose students were mainly black or hispanic and most of whom received free or subsidised lunches . check the original source here a national study of us charter schools a second study compared 99 % of charter school pupils in the 4th grade ( age 9-10 ) in charter schools throughout the usa , some 50,000 pupils .
online voters identify crime as major area of concern editorial@hamhigh.co.uk 04 july 2006 an online poll of ham&high readers highlights crime and council tax as the most important areas for the new camden council administration to tackle . <qnt> readers who have voted so far voted for either of the two options , with just over 37 per cent highlighting crime as the biggest area of concern , and 28 per cent identifying council tax . almost 14 per cent said parking enforcement is the most important issue for reform or review , while 13 per cent opted for planning issues and just over three per cent chose anti social behaviour orders .
other new items in the game include extra special ' rares ' , which in addition to weapons and armour can be anything from a never-ending supply of arrowheads to one-off gems that temporarily increase a player 's skill to previously untouchable levels . <qnt> the new items take advantage of the game 's overhauled graphics engine , which delivers all-new high-resolution textures ( not pictured ) as well as a more diverse colour palette , higher polygon counts and improved 3d rendering and draw distance . a lot of old items and creatures have also had makeovers , but the most noticeable change is to the actual environments , with previous areas perhaps dulled by familiarity now looking fresh and new .
on august 24 , 2006 , police raided a house in the village of uch-kiliz ( near termez ) and detained 17 members of the union of independent churches , many of whom were subsequently beaten . <qnt> the detainees were freed within 24 hours , but five of them were held until september 4 , 2006. in this reporting period , there were several reported instances of the government raiding services and imposing fines for worshipping , teaching , proselytizing , or other unauthorized religious activity . although the authorities tolerated the existence of many christian evangelical groups , they strictly enforced the law 's ban on proselytizing , and often harassed , detained or fined those who openly tried to convert muslims to christianity .
we all work in common , we ( choir monks ) , our lay-brothers and our hired hands , each according to his own capability , and we all make our living in common by our labour. [ the cistercian monk in idungus of prufung 's dialogue of two monks . <qnt> the total rice area ( 31 million ha ) in china is currently planted to hybrid rice , and by the end of 2002 it was estimated that a further 800,000 hectares of hybrid rice were planted in bangladesh , india , indonesia , myanmar , the philippines and vietnam . china , the world 's most populous country , is also the world 's largest producer of rice but , as consumption begins to outstrip production , china has begun to import rice from thailand and vietnam .
they found that 80 % of those identified as free people of color ( or other ) in the federal censuses in north carolina from 1790-1810 were descended from african americans free in virginia during the colonial period . <qnt> those free african-american families in virginia were descended from unions between white women ( servant or free ) and african or african-american men ( servant , slave or free ) , reflecting the fluid nature of relationships among the working classes . from documenting family histories through original documents , heinegg and demarce have traced most lumbee ancestors and have been able to construct genealogies that show the migration of specific families and individuals from virginia to north carolina .
freud 's basic thesis was that children 's early sexuality is polymorphous and that strong incestuous drives develop , and the child must harness or sublimate these to develop a healthy adult sexuality . <qnt> freud 's theories ( such as penis envy ) have been largely superseded , and many modern experts consider his work obsolete , and the core body of his work has never been entirely accepted by the scientific and medical communities . alfred kinsey ( 1894-1956 ) , in the kinsey reports ( 1948 and 1953 ) , included research on the physical sexual response of children , including pre-pubescent children ( though the main focus of the reports was adults ) .
the " yakumo " was one of six armored cruisers ordered for construction by overseas shipyards after the first sino-japanese war as part of the " six-six program " ( six battleships-six cruisers ) intended to be the backbone of the imperial japanese navy . <qnt> the orders were placed with shipyards in the united kingdom , but for political and diplomatic reasons , the " yakumo " was ordered from germany and her near-sister ship , the was ordered from france . the " yakumo " was the only cruiser in the imperial japanese navy built by germany , but was armed with british guns , to keep its ammunition compatible with other ships in the fleet .
alongside the skills and dedication required by the hillier plantsmen to produce something new , the company has continued to develop the marketing skills needed to ensure that the new plants would be commercially successful . <qnt> the principles behind the rhs award of garden merit scheme can and have been , applied to hillier new plants to ensure that they are good and garden worthy plants . as well as being unique in some way they should be relatively easy to grow , hardy , stable and , wherever possible , have plenty of year round interest , perhaps combining two or more features such as autumn colour , fragrance , outstanding foliage and/or exceptional flower power .
the claim is likely to be repeated today by tony blair , who is giving a major speech on foreign policy , but new polling evidence indicates that a growing proportion of the british public does not believe them . <qnt> those polled - 52 per cent - said that their opinion of the prime minister has gone down because of the iraq war , and 60 per cent said they believed that the invasion of iraq was a mistake . the defence secretary also insisted that british troops will stay in iraq " as long as the iraqis need and want us " , despite criticism in the commons yesterday of the cost of the war .
cell mates/soul mates there are very few writers and campaigners who know as much as angela devlin about the well-being and problems of people who , for whatever reason , find themselves in prison cells . <qnt> those who are employed in the prison service have her gift for getting behind the facades put up by those ( usually ) desperately unhappy people who are forced to live in these institutions , and sadly , far too few share her compassion for them . as one who has made some efforts over the past few years to improve the healthcare of women prisoners , i have found her earlier writings on prison issues of enormous value , particularly invisible women : what 's wrong with women 's prisons .
northern ireland has only a limited number of terrestrial mammals probably because they failed to cross the land connections with britain before these were broken by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice-age . <qnt> these 18 species such as the irish stoat and irish hare show marked genetic differences from their uk counterparts and some species , although identical to those in britain , utilise different types of habitat . ehs has availed of data collected by volunteer ornithologists and botanists and a similar contribution from people with an interest in mammals can only add value to our biodiversity efforts .
for a time the tifosi looked set to celebrate a ferrari 1-2 , but by the time the chequered flag fell , the red cars were gone , and the circuit exit roads were busy . <qnt> the pre-race favourites were around in the late laps , and thus it was that johnny herbert scored his second unexpected win of the season , the benetton renault followed over the line by mika häkkinen 's mclaren mercedes . jean alesi was not in the best of spirits after qualifying , vastly disappointed to be only 5th on the grid , but his mood improved on sunday morning , when he set fastest time in the warm up , followed by poleman coulthard and teammate berger .
the wealthiest , nowadays , decide what we listen to and watch using staggering public relations campaigns ; most releases are " format " productions where talent , passion and creativity come after profits and greed . <qnt> us feel that they should look into wider availability and more affordable pricing instead of claiming higher moral ground as an excuse to prop up an outdated and failing business model . ironically , dramatic theaters , opera houses and so forth are desperately trying to find an audience among the " common " people , as their traditionally highbrow image is not allowing them to be competitive .
taiwanese politicians not linked to the kmt had been able to run for office and had done so ( especially in local government elections ) during the 1950 's and 1960 's . <qnt> them were elected to national or provincial posts , largely because of their lack of resources , organisation and the fact that the government controlled press always supported the single party kmt dictatorship . the gradual emergence of a sense of taiwanese identity and the accumulation of discontent meant that electoral oppositionists ( known as the tangwai , people outside the party ) began to attract more support .
it is the interest of the master to have moral and intelligent people in his employ , and to make them comfortable , cleanly , and decent ; and i hope you will see us improving every time you visit us . <qnt> the new houses which you observed upon as wanting drainage , &c. , belong ; to this company ; what is required in that matter will be set about very shortly , and a school will be built there , and a space set apart in a field for gardens , &c . we employ a man at 10s. a-week to go through our rows of houses here every morning , and clean everything and carry away all refuse , &c.. but the habits of the people are such that in a few hours things are again in the state you see .
surrounding this is a cavity , which is dominated by atomic and ionised gas , which contains a total mass ~ 1 - 3 106 mo , and has a luminosity ~ 7 106 - 2.3 107 lo . <qnt> this luminosity is absorbed by material lying close to the centre , and then re-emitted as ir continuum , or via atomic and molecular line emission ( av to the nucleus = 30 magnitudes ) . zylka et al ( 1995 ) show that the column density of warm ( t ~ 200 - 400 k ) absorbing dust in the centre of the cavity is much lower from the surrounding circum-nuclear disc ( cnd ) ; a torus of dense and warm atomic and molecular gas and dust .
a company could , as a result , benefit from a more highly skilled potential workforce , a community with a stronger economy and , therefore higher levels of discretionary income , lower crime rates and a more attractive environment for employees . <qnt> the above can have a significant bottom-line impact for the business , which can be increased if the company ties its donations of goods , time and money to pre-existing business goals . do n't forget the societal impact for these benefits to truly accrue , however , the involvement of the business must be of genuine value in meeting the needs of the community .

the romance was over within a few years , but beatty and christie ultimately worked together on three major films of the 70s : mccabe and mrs. miller ( 71 ) , shampoo ( 75 ) , and heaven can wait ( 78 ) . <qnt> christie 's films of the 70s and 80s seemed worthy of her talents--the go-between ( 71 ) and her cameo in nashville ( 75 ) being exceptions--though in fact she was less interested in pursuing a career than in campaigning for various social and political causes . christie 's performance in the british tv movie the railway station man ( 92 ) , was a choice example of her devotion to social issues -- in this case , the ongoing ideological ( and shooting ) war in ireland .
mozart , then between 14 and 17 , was still very much under his father 's thumb and it was to be another eight years before he broke free from salzburg , settled in vienna and married constanze weber . <qnt> thus music was written in a hurry -- no less than four works ( k168-71 ) were composed in the single month of august 1773 -- and in any case the style is hardly personal , nor is the quality striking . indeed , the late hans keller declared in the mozart companion ( london : 1956 ) that " on the whole , mozart 's early quartets are quite abominable ... why play them at all and thus insult mozart 's genius ? "
although the kind of study involved here may be new to some students , the fact that the theories are explored within specific childrenâs texts , notably the perennially popular but ever changing genres of fairy tale and animal story should make them more accessible . <qnt> the concerns relating to childrenâs literature are also explored in various ways throughout those modules which have more of a period basis , and the relation between text and picture is problematised in the visual texts course . the chronological study of literature for children is pursued before the student is given the freer choice of subject and approach of individual study in the research enquiry and the dissertation .
the city is effectively on a " grid " system , in which ocean boulevard serves as the dividing line between north and south , and pine avenue dividing the city on the east and west . <qnt> the city is north of ocean boulevard , thus only addresses which are on the south side of the city need to be identified as being " south " , while addresses in the north section of the city are never identified as " north " . while more than 2/ 3 of the city is east of pine avenue , addresses on the west side are not given a geographical designation , addresses on the east side are designated as " east " .
others to have passed through our shores include imants bleidelis ( also southampton ) , andrejs tolcers ( fulham ) , andrejs rubins ( crystal palace ) , igors stepanovs ( arsenal ) and vit&#257;lijs astafjevs ( bristol rovers ) who with 98 caps , holds his country 's record for international appearances . <qnt> the above have played a large part in the recent successful latvian qualifying campaign for euro 2004 , but the one man who did more than any other to secure his country 's ticket to portugal has always played his club football at home . m&#257;risverpakovskis has scored in latvia 's last four competitive games , including the winner against sweden to secure their place in the play-offs , the winner against turkey in the first leg in riga , and the final goal in their 2-2 draw in istanbul which clinched qualification .
not merely are we an exception to the rest of the world ; our constitutional arrangements are also an exception to the general run of arrangements in other great british institutions : sporting clubs and federations , college bodies , learned and professional institutions , political parties , trade unions . <qnt> them have a code of rules written down in a single document and special procedures for changing those rules - procedures which tend to be elaborate , to require extra-large majorities for approval , and to require that approval to be spread over an unusually large number of meetings or conferences . so the british parliamentary system is unusual in that way too , that exactly the same procedure is gone through , regardless of whether the measure is some profound constitutional alteration or the hairdressing ( scotland ) amendment bill .
this would mean a loss of business to bexley catering services and the council would have to use outside suppliers for provision of a bar , waiters/waitresses , tables , linen , some glassware and serving dishes etc as the academy is geared up for catering for students rather than for more formal occasions . <qnt> this represents any significant difficulty although there will be additional time and effort involved in the organisation of the event if it takes place away from the civic offices . the head of building control has advised that at present there are some outstanding fire safety issues requiring improvements to the fire alarm system at the academy and that once these are resolved a final completion certificate can be issued by building control under building regulations .
in order to enable the experimenter and other reviewers to detect the presence of systematic errors in the experiment , it is suggested to include with the reported thermal properties , a plot of the measured temperature together with the temperature predicted by the model and residuals . <qnt> the systematic errors ( including those we are not aware off ) will result in residuals not being scattered evenly throughout the measurement time interval , but rather , have a shape ( horizontal " s " shape or " u " shape ) . unfortunately , the residuals plot is not a quantitative tool and cannot tell the source or the exact nature of the systematic error , this still remains a major task of the experimenter .
the nomad-online select squad recovered from an early setback to win its first ever match in some style , to claim the nomad-online invitation charity cup against their opponents from worthing . <qnt> the nomad squad had met before the match , let alone played together , and that unfamiliarity was punished as early as the second minute when chris martin fired the rebels into the lead past player-manager dean bradford , in the nomad goal . the lead did not last long however , as the nomad side began to play some attractive football , and drew level on 8 minutes with a flick from the edge of the six yard box by simon whitney .
' the main inspiration for my designs comes from historic imagery â medieval tapestries and chaucerâs canterbury tales â this is evident in the highly illustrative and humorous decoration in which i often depict scenes of lavish interiors and revelry . <qnt> the commissions i work on contain personal elements specific to the commissioner ; for example a candlestick commissioned for presentation to hrh the prince of wales depicted caricatures of both the prince and his private secretary playing musical instruments of their choice . similarly personalised was the mirror created for dame muriel spark where the library room featured every title in the authorâs lengthy catalogue. ' fiona exhibited her work for the first time at chelsea crafts fair from 11 to 16 october 2005 .
in all a dead calmness is a collection of 14 stories that range in quality from good to very good and only one of them stood out as below par with the rest , but more on that later . <qnt> the tales in this creepy collection are around 2000 words ( mostly written for limited criteria submissions between 2001-2004 ) and because of this they sometimes annoyed me , but only because i wanted more . the majority worked extremely well at stirring images in the mind , forcing this reader to expand on steve 's written word and hence , in my opinion , making the stories more than worth the price of admission .
the grampians national park , with its breathtaking landscape of soaring sandstone mountains and deep gorges , waterfalls and forests is also one of australia 's most important areas for aboriginal art . <qnt> this is easily accessible from melbourne , one of australia 's most glamorous , cosmopolitan cities with a reputation for great shopping , superb restaurants and a flourishing and lively cultural scene . they say spirituality is rising up the agenda in the united reformed church and it does seem that more people are interested in what has been seen as a minority interest .
in earlier times , the cyclists ' touring club gave seals of approval , in the form of a cast metal plaque showing the winged-wheel symbol of ctc , for mounting on an outside wall of hotels and restaurants which offered good accommodation and service to cyclists . <qnt> the metal plaques still exist , as do a handful of road signs put up by ctc to warn cyclists of steep hills : usually steep going down , which was as much a problem for riders of large-wheel ordinaries , or " penny-farthings " , as going up . nowadays , ctc no longer puts up general road signs - although the right to do so is retained - and approved establishments are offered a plastic window-sticker carrying the blue and yellow logo shown above .
the july 13 , 1999 , compact disc reissue included six bonus tracks , four singles and two b-sides recorded over the span of a year and issued in 1961 and 1962 , and altered the album 's running order . <qnt> the sides made the top 40 at a time when billboard charted b-sides as well , and two of the singles , " surrender " and " good luck charm " topped the singles chart . " surrender " had been recorded at the sessions for presley 's gospel album of 1960 , " his hand in mine " , and the sides for 47-7908 and 47-7992 at sessions specifically to produce singles .
he then travels to various locations to ask questions of researchers , and he often he puts himself into situations ( e. g. working in a quarry , climbing a rockface ) that simulate the activities of people in the time period he is exploring . <qnt> the researchers he talks to are professionals in the subject at hand , and many of the places he visits ( e. g. the inside of a pyramid ) are not open to the general public . at the end of the each episode , josh pulls together everything discussed in the episode to either formulate a hypothesis of what actually happened historically or to conclude that what really happened remains a mystery .
the surface of each of the dendrites which branch out from the neuronal cell body is covered with synapses -- perhaps up to ten thousand in all -- arising from the other neurons which thus make contact with them . <qnt> these synapses are on the shafts of the dendrites , others are attached to the tiny spines which stud the dendritic surface and which can be seen in figure 10.6 . changes in synaptic connectivity between one neuron and another as a result of learning along hebbian lines might involve the dendrites increasing in length , or changing in branching pattern , or the numbers of their spines might alter .
i spent some minutes sat behind an audi a8 in traffic on the promenade des anglais in nice during the launch , and i 'd swear i was in the wider car . <qnt> these faults should put you off buying a civic if the blake 's 7 look floats your boat , but i feel duty bound to warn you that it will probably all start to look very dated right about... now . ps : having been tiresomely sanctimonious about the lavish hospitality/institutionalised bribery of car launches in the past , i would like to point out that i accepted no hospitality from honda , and went to nice and back in a day ( despite dropping hints about feeling tired and in need of five-star pampering ) .
most of them orbit the sun just like the planets , in orbits that lie between those of mars and jupiter , several times further away from the sun than the earth . <qnt> them are very large , thoroughly deserving their altemative name of " minor planets " ; some are the size of mountains , a few kilometres across ; there are lots of boulders some tens of metres across , and enormous quantities of dust . nasa sent a mission to one asteroid , eros , and photographed it from close quarters ( appropriate!y enough on st valentine 's day , 2000 ) ; it too was pock-marked with the craters from impacts of smaller bodies .
in july of 1969 , an incident that came to be known as " the boy in the box " saw 13 members of the lodge charged with mistreatment of the six-year-old son of one the members . <qnt> these members went to jail for 6 months on a felony conviction , a few went to jail for 3 months on a misdemeanor conviction , and a few had their charges dismissed . brayton , her husband , and other " officers , " fled to arizona , then mexico , then canada , and finally returned to los angeles in 1972 to engage in a publicity campaign alleging a conspiracy against them by law enforcement officers and the courts .
a final warning means that the offences will stay on their records until they are 18 years old and if they are arrested again for the same kind of offence within the next two years they will be charged and put before the courts . <qnt> those who were given final warnings have also been told that they will be approached to help on clean-up days that the council are currently looking at the possibility of arranging in the future . tandridge neighbourhood inspector steve whitcombe said : since april we have not had a single reported incident of graffiti in the caterham area and so we are clearly having an impact on the offenders .
